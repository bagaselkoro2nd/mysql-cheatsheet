## insert data
* Single row
    ```sh
    INSERT INTO products(product_id,name,price,quantity,category_id) 
    VALUES('P0001','Popcorn Creamello 150gram',12000,40,1);
    ```
* Multiple row
    ```sh
    INSERT INTO products(product_id,name,price,quantity,category_id) 
    VALUES('P0002','Tricks backed chips',10000,50,1),
          ('P0003','Rondoleti wafer',29000,10,1),
          ('P0004','Kripik pisang sale',10000,80,1);

    WHERE product_id = 'P0004';
    ```
    NOTE:  
    - if you not use where clause sql will change all data. so be careful
    - we can use arithmetic operations when updating data
        ```
        UPDATE products set price = price + 500 WHERE product_id = 'P0004';
        ```
<br />

## delete data
*   This statement is used to delete data with specific row at table.
    ```sh
    DELETE FROM products
    WHERE products_id = 'P0001';
    ```
    NOTE:  
    - if you not use where clause sql will delete all data. so be careful
<br />

## select data
* All column. 
    ```sh
    SELECT * FROM products;
    ```
    
* specific column
    ```sh
    SELECT product_id, name FROM products;
    ```

* alias
    ```sh
    SELECT p.product_id AS 'ID Produk', 
           p.name       AS 'Produk name' 
    FROM products AS p;
    ```

* order by
    ```sh
    SELECT * FROM products 
    ORDER BY price DESC;
    ```
    NOTE:  
    - ASC is used to sort from smallest to largest
    - DESC is used to sort from largest to smallest

* limit
    ```sh
    SELECT * FROM products LIMIT {offset},{limit data};
    ```
    ```sh
    SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 2,1;
    ```
    NOTE: _sql above syntax will display product data starting from row with index 2 and display only one data_

* distinct <br/>
    _This statement is used to remove redundant data at table_
    ```sh
    SELECT DISTINCT price FROM products;
    ```
    | price(without distinct) | price(with distinct)|
    | :---: | :---: |
    | 10000 | 10000 |
    | 10000 | 12000 |

    <br />

* div <br/>
    *The DIV function is used for integer division.*
    ```sh

           price div 1000 AS 'with div' 
    FROM products;
    ```
